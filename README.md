# qbasic-legacy
Found some of my old QB codes from the mid-late nineties that I wrote on an old donated 386 and a Win95/98 machine, committing for posterity.

Unfortunately I lost a large number of scripts that I remember writing but I can't find anymore.

Ported some of them to QB64, which you can find under releases.

I used the fonts from [here](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/).
